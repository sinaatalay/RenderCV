# `cv` Field

## Header Information

The `cv` field begins with your personal information. All fields are optional. RenderCV adapts to whatever you provide.

```yaml
cv:
  name: John Doe
  headline: Machine Learning Engineer
  location: San Francisco, CA
  email: john@example.com # (1)!
  phone: "+14155551234" # (2)!
  website: https://johndoe.dev # (3)!
  photo: photo.jpg
  social_networks:
    - network: LinkedIn # (4)!
      username: johndoe
    - network: GitHub
      username: johndoe
  custom_connections:
    - placeholder: Book a call # (5)!
      url: https://cal.com/johndoe
      fontawesome_icon: calendar-days
```

1. Multiple emails can be provided as a list.
2. Multiple phone numbers can be provided as a list. The display format (national, international, or E164) can be controlled with [`design.header.connections.phone_number_format`](design.md).
3. Multiple websites can be provided as a list.
4. Available social networks: << available_social_networks >>
5. Custom connections let you add any extra link (or plain text if `url` is omitted) with your own display text (`placeholder`) and a Font Awesome icon name (e.g., `calendar-days`, `envelope`). For the list of available icons, see [fontawesome.com/search](https://fontawesome.com/search).

## Sections

The `sections` field holds the main content of your CV. It's a dictionary where:

- **Keys** are section titles (displayed as headings). Section titles can be anything.
- **Values** are usually lists of entries

```yaml
cv:
  name: John Doe

  sections:
    summary:
      - Software engineer with 10 years of experience in distributed systems.

    experience:
      - company: Acme Corp
        position: Senior Engineer
        start_date: 2020-01
        end_date: present
        highlights:
          - Led migration to microservices architecture
          - Reduced deployment time by 80%

    education:
      - institution: MIT
        area: Computer Science
        degree: BS
        start_date: 2012-09
        end_date: 2016-05

    skills:
      - label: Languages
        details: Python, Go, Rust, TypeScript
      - label: Infrastructure
        details: Kubernetes, Terraform, AWS
```

Sections can also be grouped into subsections with `SubsectionEntry`:

```yaml
cv:
  sections:
    selected_work:
      - title: Journal Articles
        entries:
          - title: Example Journal Paper
            authors:
              - John Doe
            date: 2024-01
      - title: Featured Projects
        entries:
          - name: RenderCV
            summary: Support subsection-based sections across the whole CV.
```

`SubsectionEntry` is a grouping model rather than a standalone rendered entry type:

```yaml
<< subsection_entry_yaml >>
```

**Section names are just titles.** You can use any of the << entry_count >> entry types in any section. Choose what works best for your content.

For example, `experience` section could use `NormalEntry`:

```yaml
sections:
  experience:
    - name: Acme Corp — Senior Engineer
      start_date: 2020-01
      end_date: present
      highlights:
        - Led migration to microservices architecture
```

Or `BulletEntry` for a minimal style:

```yaml
sections:
  experience:
    - bullet: "**Acme Corp** — Senior Engineer (2020–present)"
    - bullet: "**StartupXYZ** — Founding Engineer (2018–2020)"
```


!!! warning "Keep section structure consistent"
    Each section must contain only one kind of top-level item: either a flat list of entries or a list of `SubsectionEntry`.

    Flat sections must contain only one entry type. In subsection-based sections, each subsection must still contain only one entry type, but different subsections can use different entry types.

## Entry Types

RenderCV provides << entry_count >> entry types:
{$ for entry_name in entry_names $}
<< loop.index >>. << entry_name >>
{$ endfor $}
each rendered differently on the PDF.

{$ for entry_name, entry in sample_entries.items() $}
### << entry_name >>

{$ if entry_name == "EducationEntry" $}
For academic credentials.

## Text Formatting & Features

### Using Markdown

All text fields support basic Markdown:

```yaml
highlights:
  - Increased revenue by **$2M** annually
  - Developed [open-source tool](https://github.com/example) with *500+ stars*
```

- `**text**` → **bold**
- `*text*` → *italic*
- `[text](url)` → hyperlink
- `` `code` `` → `code`

### Using Typst

All text fields support

- Typst math (surround with `$$` like `$$f(x) = x^2$$`)
- Typst commands (like `#emph[emphasized]`).

```yaml
highlights:
  - Showed that $$f(x) = x^2$$ is a parabola
  - "This is an #emph[emphasized] text"
```

### Arbitrary Keys

You can add arbitrary keys to any entry. By default, they're ignored, but you can reference them in `design.templates` field. See [Arbitrary Keys in Entries](../how_to/arbitrary_keys_in_entries.md) for more information.

```yaml hl_lines="6"
experience:
  - company: Startup Inc
    position: Founder
    start_date: 2020-01
    end_date: present
    revenue: $5M ARR  # Custom field
    highlights:
      - Built product from zero to profitability
```
