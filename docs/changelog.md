## [2.9] - October 22, 2026

> **Full Changelog**: [v2.8...v2.9]

### Added

- Subsections: `SubsectionEntry` has a `title` and its own `entries`. Each list contains one entry type, which can itself be `SubsectionEntry` for deeper nesting ([#254](https://github.com/rendercv/rendercv/issues/254), [#545](https://github.com/rendercv/rendercv/issues/545), [#694](https://github.com/rendercv/rendercv/issues/694)). Their titles are styled with the new `subsection_titles` options of `design.typography` and `design.colors`, and spaced with `design.subsection_titles`.
- Overlays: `--overlay FILE` and `settings.render_command.overlays` merge YAML files over the input file, like private contact details over a CV published with placeholders ([#740](https://github.com/rendercv/rendercv/issues/740), [#747](https://github.com/rendercv/rendercv/issues/747)), or parts of a CV kept in their own files ([#477](https://github.com/rendercv/rendercv/issues/477)). See [Combine YAML Files](user_guide/how_to/combine_yaml_files.md).
- Localized section titles: `locale.section_labels` changes displayed headings while preserving the section keys used by overlays and design options ([#741](https://github.com/rendercv/rendercv/issues/741), [#742](https://github.com/rendercv/rendercv/pull/742)).
- SVG files, one per page, are generated like PNG files, with `svg_path` and `dont_generate_svg` ([#731](https://github.com/rendercv/rendercv/issues/731)).
- `settings.sort_entries` is back: entries can be ordered by date, the most recent first or the oldest first ([#794](https://github.com/rendercv/rendercv/issues/794)).
- PDFs conform to PDF/UA-1, the accessibility standard, by default, and `settings.pdf_standards` selects other standards, like PDF/A for archiving ([#769](https://github.com/rendercv/rendercv/issues/769)).
- A `TIME_SPAN` placeholder shows how long an entry lasted, on its own line in the default templates ([#547](https://github.com/rendercv/rendercv/issues/547), [#696](https://github.com/rendercv/rendercv/issues/696), [#770](https://github.com/rendercv/rendercv/issues/770)).
- `design.templates.shorten_date_ranges` writes the parts that the dates of a range share once, like `Mar – Jun 2023` ([#716](https://github.com/rendercv/rendercv/issues/716), [#735](https://github.com/rendercv/rendercv/issues/735)).
- A `DAY_ORDINAL` date placeholder, like `6th`, written by each locale in `locale.day_ordinals` ([#732](https://github.com/rendercv/rendercv/issues/732)).
- CLI overrides can add a list item at the index after the last one ([#774](https://github.com/rendercv/rendercv/issues/774)).
- Built-in locales for Swedish ([#713](https://github.com/rendercv/rendercv/issues/713), [#802](https://github.com/rendercv/rendercv/issues/802)), Polish ([#714](https://github.com/rendercv/rendercv/issues/714)), and Catalan ([#800](https://github.com/rendercv/rendercv/issues/800)).
- HuggingFace ([#746](https://github.com/rendercv/rendercv/issues/746)), Itch.io, and Devpost ([#756](https://github.com/rendercv/rendercv/issues/756)) social networks, WhatsApp usernames ([#777](https://github.com/rendercv/rendercv/issues/777)), and longer IMDb IDs ([#806](https://github.com/rendercv/rendercv/issues/806)).
- Custom connections can be plain text, without a URL ([#803](https://github.com/rendercv/rendercv/issues/803)).
- Chinese, Japanese, and Korean are rendered with the bundled Noto Sans fonts, in the variant of the CV's language ([#655](https://github.com/rendercv/rendercv/issues/655)).
- Small capitals are synthesized when the font doesn't have them, like in the section titles of the `ember` and `opal` themes ([#807](https://github.com/rendercv/rendercv/issues/807)).
- Python 3.15 is supported.

### Changed

- User content is parsed once into a tree and emitted once, as Typst or Markdown, instead of being rewritten as text several times. Escaping now follows the grammars exactly: `"` makes smart quotes, and `%`, `>`, and `/` are text.
- A template placeholder without a value is removed together with the formatting, brackets, and connecting words that only existed for it.
- Markdown and HTML headings nest like the PDF's: sections are level 2 (they were level 1, like the name), subsections level 3, and entries one level below their section.
- A date range whose dates are displayed the same, like `Jan 2020 – Jan 2020`, is written as one date, and the time spans of month ranges count whole months (February to March is 2 months).
- An entry's header never ends a page without its content ([#190](https://github.com/rendercv/rendercv/issues/190)).
- `dont_generate_typst` no longer disables PDF and PNG generation, which compile from memory ([#730](https://github.com/rendercv/rendercv/issues/730), [#760](https://github.com/rendercv/rendercv/issues/760)).
- Paths given on the command line are relative to the current working directory ([#752](https://github.com/rendercv/rendercv/issues/752)), and the design, locale, and settings files are chosen with the precedence CLI > settings file > main file ([#776](https://github.com/rendercv/rendercv/issues/776)). Every render, and every re-render of watch mode, reads them again.
- The photo must be an image: PNG, JPEG, GIF, WebP, SVG, or PDF ([#598](https://github.com/rendercv/rendercv/issues/598)).
- Templates written for RenderCV 1 are rejected with an explanation instead of printing their syntax ([#721](https://github.com/rendercv/rendercv/issues/721)).
- Custom theme names must start with a letter, everywhere ([#771](https://github.com/rendercv/rendercv/issues/771)), and the design options of a custom theme without an `__init__.py` are validated.
- Validation errors are classified by their type instead of their text, and a mistyped language lists the available ones.
- The `rendercv-fonts` package is developed in this repository, as a uv workspace package, and its version 0.6.0 has Font Awesome 7.3.1.
- The Typst package `@preview/rendercv` is version 0.4.0.
- The Docker image uses Python 3.15 on Debian trixie and the user ID 1000 ([#780](https://github.com/rendercv/rendercv/issues/780)).
- The AI agent skill is generated in this repository and published with each release ([#784](https://github.com/rendercv/rendercv/issues/784), [#785](https://github.com/rendercv/rendercv/issues/785), [#787](https://github.com/rendercv/rendercv/issues/787), [#788](https://github.com/rendercv/rendercv/issues/788), [#791](https://github.com/rendercv/rendercv/issues/791), [#792](https://github.com/rendercv/rendercv/issues/792), [#793](https://github.com/rendercv/rendercv/issues/793), [#767](https://github.com/rendercv/rendercv/issues/767)).
- The documentation is built with Zensical ([#728](https://github.com/rendercv/rendercv/issues/728)). The pages of the API reference are now under `api_reference/rendercv/`.
- All dependencies have been upgraded, including Typst 0.15.

### Fixed

- Nested highlights are nested again ([#712](https://github.com/rendercv/rendercv/issues/712), [#754](https://github.com/rendercv/rendercv/issues/754), [#786](https://github.com/rendercv/rendercv/issues/786)).
- Formatting around a date that spans several lines is closed and reopened on each line ([#705](https://github.com/rendercv/rendercv/issues/705)).
- `bold_keywords` bolds whole words only, whatever their first and last characters ([#706](https://github.com/rendercv/rendercv/issues/706)), and never inside bold text, code, or links ([#736](https://github.com/rendercv/rendercv/issues/736)).
- The `sb2nov` theme uses the locale's degree phrase ([#755](https://github.com/rendercv/rendercv/issues/755), [#759](https://github.com/rendercv/rendercv/issues/759)), the `harvard` theme no longer shows the degree twice ([#804](https://github.com/rendercv/rendercv/issues/804)), and `ember` and `ink` no longer print a stray `*`.
- The HTML page has the CV's title ([#805](https://github.com/rendercv/rendercv/issues/805)).
- Phone numbers are laid out left to right in right-to-left CVs ([#781](https://github.com/rendercv/rendercv/issues/781)).
- A section named `interests`, `internships`, or anything containing `int`, `str`, or `list` no longer crashes the error report ([#758](https://github.com/rendercv/rendercv/issues/758)).
- `--settings` with `--output-folder` no longer crashes ([#551](https://github.com/rendercv/rendercv/issues/551)).
- Exceptions keep their messages ([#757](https://github.com/rendercv/rendercv/issues/757)), and `rendercv new` and `rendercv create-theme` honor `--quiet` ([#751](https://github.com/rendercv/rendercv/issues/751)).
- A saved Typst file compiles on its own, with the photo next to it ([#778](https://github.com/rendercv/rendercv/issues/778)).
- Phone numbers are serialized the same as a single value and in a list ([#789](https://github.com/rendercv/rendercv/issues/789), [#790](https://github.com/rendercv/rendercv/issues/790)), and lengths can start with a decimal point, like `.5cm` ([#798](https://github.com/rendercv/rendercv/issues/798), [#799](https://github.com/rendercv/rendercv/issues/799)).
- The JSON Schema accepts custom themes ([#772](https://github.com/rendercv/rendercv/issues/772)) and is the same on every operating system.
- Font Awesome icons render offline, in the Docker image too: the Font Awesome Typst package ships with RenderCV instead of being downloaded on the first render ([#775](https://github.com/rendercv/rendercv/issues/775)).
- A `/` or another character that can't be in a file name, in the CV owner's name, no longer makes directories in the output folder: it's replaced by `_` in file names.

## [2.8] - March 21, 2026

> **Full Changelog**: [v2.7...v2.8]

### Added

- Four new themes have been added: `harvard`, `ink`, `opal`, and `ember`.

### Fixed

- Custom fonts folder not being found when using a relative input path has been fixed ([#692](https://github.com/rendercv/rendercv/issues/692)).

- Markdown lines are now processed independently to prevent cross-line emphasis interference ([#685](https://github.com/rendercv/rendercv/issues/685)).
- Connector words in phrases no longer appear when their associated placeholder is empty (e.g., "BS in Mechanical Engineering" now correctly renders as "Mechanical Engineering" when the degree is omitted, instead of "in Mechanical Engineering").
- `EducationEntry` location placement in markdown output has been fixed ([#691](https://github.com/rendercv/rendercv/issues/691)).

- PNG files for each page can be generated now ([#57](https://github.com/rendercv/rendercv/issues/57)).

  rendercv create-theme "customtheme" --based-on "classic"
  ```
- [A developer guide](https://docs.rendercv.com/developer_guide/) has been written.
- New options have been added to the `rendercv render` command:
    - `--output-folder-name "OUTPUT_FOLDER_NAME"`: Generates the output files in a folder with the given name. By default, the output folder name is `rendercv_output`. The output folder will be created in the current working directory. ([#58](https://github.com/rendercv/rendercv/issues/58))
    - `--latex-path LATEX_PATH`: Copies the generated $\LaTeX$ source code from the output folder and pastes it to the specified path.
    - `--pdf-path PDF_PATH`: Copies the generated PDF file from the output folder and pastes it to the specified path.
    - `--markdown-path MARKDOWN_PATH`: Copies the generated Markdown file from the output folder and pastes it to the specified path.
    - `--html-path HTML_PATH`: Copies the generated HTML file from the output folder and pastes it to the specified path.

Sensitive information, like phone numbers, can be passed as a command-line argument with environment variables. This method is also beneficial for creating multiple CVs using the same YAML file by changing only a few values.
- New options have been added to the `rendercv new` command:
